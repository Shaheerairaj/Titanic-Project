# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This is my attempt at the popular data science competition on Kaggle "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster". The purpose of this project is to get my hands dirty and practice different data science and machine learning problems available on the internet.

## Folders:

The "Data" folder contains all the data we will be working with for this project. It contains a training set, test set and an example submission file.

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

## Jupyter Notebooks:

The "titanic.ipynb" will be the main notebook that I will be using for all analysis.

## References:

I'll be adding links to any notebooks, articles, papers that I have used in this project here
